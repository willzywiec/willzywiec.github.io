          <br>Whenever I run a physics code that crashes with nondescript error messages:

        </p>

        <p><strong>April 15, 2023</strong>
          <br>I recently started modeling polymer mixtures to study and optimize their radiation transport properties.
          Most of the test samples I make in the lab look like tiny pink cupcakes.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>I fixed minor geometry and density logic errors.
          The success rate is now 100%.
          There are still a few cross section calls and tallies I need to adjust to make the MCNP simulations more accurate, but everything works.
          I reconfigured the script to check and plot errors to verify the successful completion of all 10,000 simulations.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>I fixed a material error, which eliminated all but 24 failures.
          The minimum success rate is now 99.78%.

          </div>
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>I fixed a density error, which eliminated the rest of the <b>fatal errors</b>.
          The minimum success rate is now 96.87%.

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>I fixed a source particle distribution error, which reduced the number of <b>fatal errors</b> and eliminated all <b>wrong length</b> failures.
          The minimum success rate is now 95.2%.
        </p><p>

        </p>

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>The <b>10 particles got lost</b> failures are completely gone. The minimum success rate is now 86.88%.
        </p><p>
          <div class="container">
            <input type="checkbox" id="error3">

            </label>
          </div>
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>I indexed all of the <b>10 particles got lost</b> failures, plotted a few of them, and saw pretty clear geometry errors, so I refactored a couple lines of code and was able to fix the affected input decks.
          Now rerunning 776 MCNP simulations.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>Preliminary results:
        </p><p>
          <div class="container">
            <input type="checkbox" id="error2">
            <label for="error2">
              <img src="images/error2.png" width="300" alt=""/>
            </label>
          </div>
        </p><p>
          I looked at the output and <b>bad trouble</b> and <b>impossible</b> turned out to be redundant failures, so I ignored <b>impossible</b>.
          This caused the minimum success rate to rise to 79.33%, which isn't much of an improvement.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 23, 2021</strong>
          <br>I took a brief pause after 2,259 MCNP simulations and plotted the results:
        </p><p>
          <div class="container">
            <input type="checkbox" id="error1">
            <label for="error1">
              <img src="images/error1.png" width="300" alt=""/>
            </label>
          </div>
        </p><p>
          Overall, this represents a minimum success rate of 76.18%, which isn't terrible.
          I haven't checked for failure redundancy, but I don't really care at this point because the goal is to get to 100%.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 23, 2021</strong>
          <br>I'm building a few different MCNP simulation databases, and the input code I inherited to run these simulations is messy and fails a lot, so I thought I'd post these failures as I iteratively fix them.
          The keywords I'll be searching for are <b>bad trouble</b>, <b>fatal error</b>, <b>impossible</b>, <b>wrong length</b>, and <b>10 particles got lost</b>, with maybe a few more to be added later on.
        </p><p>
          The rules are simple: If there are one or more unique keywords in an output file, all will be counted; however, redundant keywords in the same output file will be ignored.
          As of right now, 492 out of 10,000 simulations are finished. üéÉ

          <br>The following k-effective contour plot was made using a deep neural network metamodel of MCNP6.2 simulations.
          This plot represents 0-4 kg of alpha-phase plutonium, homogeneously dispersed in a sphere of water, with one inch of water reflection.

          These results are very accurate (MAE = 2.5e-04) and outperform state-of-the-art spline fitting techniques by more than one order of magnitude.
          This graph is impossible to appreciate because it's more accurate than the width of the pixel of whatever monitor it's displayed on.

          The following graphs were from an airport TSA body scanner project, where I used R and Arena to simulate passenger queues, alarm rates, time delays, and wait times to determine how many scanners were needed to ensure less than 1% of passengers waited 30+ minutes.
          The first two sets of graphs were based on only a few simulations, which is why they appear spotty.
          These simulations were tested using real data from the Oakland International Airport.

          Even after switching luggage scanners in Terminal 2, the queue times of OAK are still the lowest in the nation for an airport of its size, geographic location, population density, and throughput.
