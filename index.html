          <br>I indexed all of the <b>10 particles got lost</b> failures, plotted a few of them, and saw pretty clear geometry errors.
          I refactored a couple lines of code and was able to fix the affected input decks.
          Now rerunning 776 MCNP simulations.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>Final results:

        </p><p>
          I looked at the output and <b>bad trouble</b> and <b>impossible</b> turned out to be redundant failures, so I ignored <b>impossible</b>.
          This caused the minimum success rate to rise to 79.33%, which isn't much of an improvement.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 23, 2021</strong>
          <br>I took a brief pause after 2,259 MCNP simulations and plotted the results:
        </p><p>
          <a href="images/error1.png"><img src="images/error1.png" width="500" alt=""/></a>
        </p><p>
          Overall, this represents a minimum success rate of 76.18%, which isn't terrible.
          I haven't checked for failure redundancy, but I don't really care at this point because the goal is to get to 100%.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 23, 2021</strong>
          <br>I'm currently building a few different MCNP simulation databases.
          The input code I adapted to run these simulations is messy and fails a lot, so I thought I'd post these failures as I iteratively fix them.
          The keywords I'll be searching for are <b>bad trouble</b>, <b>fatal error</b>, <b>impossible</b>, <b>wrong length</b>, and <b>10 particles got lost</b>, with maybe a few more to be added later on.
        </p><p>
          I don't know which keyword will win, but if I had to guess, I'd say <b>fatal error</b>.
          The rules are simple: If there are one or more unique keywords in an output file, all will be counted; however, redundant keywords in the same output file will be ignored.
          As of right now, 492 out of 10,000 simulations are finished. ðŸŽƒ

          <br>The following k-effective contour plot was made using a deep neural network metamodel of MCNP6.2 simulations.
          This plot represents 0-4 kg of alpha-phase plutonium, homogeneously dispersed in a sphere of water, with one inch of water reflection.

        </p><p>
          These results are very accurate (MAE = 2.5e-04) and outperform state-of-the-art spline fitting techniques by more than one order of magnitude.

          <br>Here are some graphs from assignments I completed when I was a graduate student.
          They were made with R and ggplot2 and formatted to appear as they do in the book <i>Getting Started with Minitab</i>.

          The following graphs were from an airport TSA body scanner project, where I used R and Arena to simulate passenger queues, alarm rates, time delays, and wait times to determine how many scanners were needed to ensure that less than 1% of passengers waited 30+ minutes.
          The first two sets of graphs were based on only a few simulations, which is why they appear spotty.
          These simulations used real data from the Oakland International Airport.
