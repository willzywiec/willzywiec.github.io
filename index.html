        <p><strong>April 15, 2023</strong>
          <br>I recently started modeling and synthesizing polymers to study their radiation transport properties.
          I'm pretty excited about this capability because it means I can rapidly prototype and test materials without waiting for a manufacturer.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 29, 2021</strong>
          <br>I fixed minor geometry and density logic errors.
          The success rate is now 100%.
          There are still a few cross section calls and tallies I need to adjust to make the MCNP simulations more accurate, but everything works.
          I reconfigured the script I wrote to check and plot errors to verify the successful completion of all 10,000 simulations.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 29, 2021</strong>
          <br>I fixed a material error, which eliminated all but 24 failures.
          The minimum success rate is now 99.78%.
        </p><p>
          <div class="container">
            <input type="checkbox" id="error6">
            <label for="error6">
              <img src="images/error6.png" width="300" alt=""/>
            </label>
          </div>
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 29, 2021</strong>
          <br>I fixed a density error, which eliminated the rest of the <b>fatal errors</b>.
          The minimum success rate is now 96.87%.
        </p><p>
          <div class="container">
            <input type="checkbox" id="error5">

            </label>
          </div>
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 29, 2021</strong>
          <br>I fixed a source particle distribution error, which reduced the number of <b>fatal errors</b> and eliminated all <b>wrong length</b> failures.
          The minimum success rate is now 95.2%.
        </p><p>
          <div class="container">
            <input type="checkbox" id="error4">
            <label for="error4">
              <img src="images/error4.png" width="300" alt=""/>
            </label>
          </div>
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>The <b>10 particles got lost</b> failures are completely gone, and the minimum success rate is now 86.88%.
        </p><p>
          <div class="container">
            <input type="checkbox" id="error3">
            <label for="error3">
              <img src="images/error3.png" width="300" alt=""/>
            </label>
          </div>
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>I indexed all of the <b>10 particles got lost</b> failures, plotted a few of them, and saw pretty clear geometry errors.
          I refactored a couple lines of code and was able to fix the affected input decks.
          Now rerunning 776 MCNP simulations.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 24, 2021</strong>
          <br>Preliminary results:
        </p><p>
          <div class="container">
            <input type="checkbox" id="error2">
            <label for="error2">
              <img src="images/error2.png" width="300" alt=""/>
            </label>
          </div>
        </p><p>
          I looked at the output and <b>bad trouble</b> and <b>impossible</b> turned out to be redundant failures, so I ignored <b>impossible</b>.
          This caused the minimum success rate to rise to 79.33%, which isn't much of an improvement.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 23, 2021</strong>
          <br>I took a brief pause after 2,259 MCNP simulations and plotted the results:
        </p><p>
          <div class="container">
            <input type="checkbox" id="error1">
            <label for="error1">
              <img src="images/error1.png" width="300" alt=""/>
            </label>
          </div>
        </p><p>
          Overall, this represents a minimum success rate of 76.18%, which isn't terrible.
          I haven't checked for failure redundancy, but I don't really care at this point because the goal is to get to 100%.
        </p>

        <p><strong>October 23, 2021</strong>
          <br>I'm currently building a few different MCNP simulation databases.
          The input code I adapted to run these simulations is messy and fails a lot, so I thought I'd post these failures as I iteratively fix them.
          The keywords I'll be searching for are <b>bad trouble</b>, <b>fatal error</b>, <b>impossible</b>, <b>wrong length</b>, and <b>10 particles got lost</b>, with maybe a few more to be added later on.
        </p><p>
          The rules are simple: If there are one or more unique keywords in an output file, all will be counted; however, redundant keywords in the same output file will be ignored.
          As of right now, 492 out of 10,000 simulations are finished. ðŸŽƒ

        <p><strong>April 17, 2021</strong>
          <br>The following k-effective contour plot was made using a deep neural network metamodel of MCNP6.2 simulations.
          This plot represents 0-4 kg of alpha-phase plutonium, homogeneously dispersed in a sphere of water, with one inch of water reflection.
        </p><p>
          <div class="container">
            <input type="checkbox" id="contour1">
            <label for="contour1">
              <img src="images/contour1.png" width="300" alt=""/>
            </label>
          </div>
        </p><p>
          These results are very accurate (MAE = 2.5e-04) and outperform state-of-the-art spline fitting techniques by more than one order of magnitude.

          <br>Here are some graphs from assignments I completed when I was a graduate student at Johns Hopkins.
          They were made with R and ggplot2 and formatted to appear as they do in the book <i>Getting Started with Minitab</i>.

          The following graphs were from an airport TSA body scanner project, where I used R and Arena to simulate passenger queues, alarm rates, time delays, and wait times to determine how many scanners were needed to ensure that less than 1% of passengers waited 30+ minutes.
          The first two sets of graphs were based on only a few simulations, which is why they appear spotty.
          These simulations used real data from the Oakland International Airport.
